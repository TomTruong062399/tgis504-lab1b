<p>1. The analysis tool I chose was <b>Union</b>.</p>

<p>2. The Turf's method of accomplishing the union tasks requires at least two polygons as inputs to return a combined Polygon or a MultiPolygon. Similarly, ArcMap requires two or more vector features which are polygons. The vector layers are usually added beforehand to be indicated. But, within JavaScript the union variable is called differently needing the polygon variables as parameters. The polygon variables are usually made up of a set of coordinates. While union on ArcMap just requires a name for the polygon/multipolygon to output the unioned feature class. It also takes the parameter of "rank", that gives priority of a polygon over the other when it comes to which one snaps to the other. Other optional parameters included with ArcMap are the tolerance levels for the clustering and the option to either join all the attributes together or just some. (Just the FID fields or all the attributes excluding FID)</p>
